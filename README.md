This is a repo where I’ll summarize scientific articles (in layman´s terms), related to I/O Psychology (if you want to know more about what I/O Psyc is, check SIOP´s or WOP-P´s websites).
Scientific literature is not only useful, it can also be extremely interesting. However, APA and other rules (like excessive use of jargon) make it hard to understand. 
This is my effort to share simplified knowledge, as well as cool visualizations (or at least cooler than APA´s).
